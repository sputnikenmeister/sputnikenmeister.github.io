The earliest production basses had a 'stacked' volume and tone control for each pickup. This was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single, passive tone control. The Jazz Bass' neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass (1½\" versus 1¾\").</p>","attrs":["background-color-tmp:#bbbab4","box-shadow:0px 6px 12px -3px rgb(0;0;0)"]},
